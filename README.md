# FlockAroundAndFindOut created by DarkSec Labs.
Meet FlockAroundAndFindOut– a compact wireless recon tool built for the M5Stack Cardputer.

DarkSecs FlockAroundAndFindOut turns your Cardputer into a portable scanner for** hidden Wi‑Fi cameras and rogue access points**:

•  Flock camera hunting  
  Uses known MAC OUIs and beacon/SSID signatures to spot camera-like devices and keeps a de‑duplicated list of unique “cameras found.”

•  Rogue AP / evil‑twin detection  
  Tracks nearby APs and flags SSIDs that show up with mixed encryption (enc + open) – a classic evil‑twin pattern – and lists them in a dedicated “Rogue AP” view.

•  Live RF telemetry  
  See packets per second, channel hopping status, and detailed counters for SSIDs, MAC matches, beacon intervals, and total traffic.

•  On‑device intelligence  
  No cloud, no backend – all analysis and UI rendering happen directly on the Cardputer, with a clean dark-themed interface, battery indicator, and optional uptime overlay.

•  Drill‑down views  
  Cycle between:
•  Overview dashboard  
•  Rogue AP list  
•  Camera MAC list (scrollable)
  so you can quickly pivot from “something’s here” to “what exactly is it?”

If you’re carrying a Cardputer and care about physical privacy, DarkSec Labs  FlockAroundAndFindOut gives you a fast, self‑contained way to sweep rooms for suspicious Wi‑Fi devices and sketchy APs without dragging a laptop into the mix.
